TODO

> ## Front end

> The code lives in the `docs` directory (it's not documentation, that's just the name GitHub requires). It uses jQuery and [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com).

> For development, just open [index.html](docs/index.html) in your browser.

> ## Back end

> The back end is served by Heroku.

> The code lives in the `master` branch. It uses Python 3, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), and PostgreSQL.

> For development, use [install_deps.sh](install_deps.sh) and [run.sh](run.sh).
